* 2. Memory Addressing
** 2.1. Memory Addresses
- 3 types of address
- MMU
- memory arbiter
- uniprocessor systems also use

** 2.2. Segmentation in Hardware

*** 2.2.1. Segment Selectors and Segmentation Registers
- content of segmentation registers
- cs, CPL

*** 2.2.2. Segment Descriptors
- 8 byts
- store in GDT or LDT
- one GDT, one process one LDT
- gdtr, ldtr store address and size
- segment descriptors' fields
- different descriptor types

*** 2.2.3. Fast Access to Segment Descriptors
- the fields of the segmemt selectors, RPL

*** 2.2.4. Segmentation Unit

** 2.3. Segmentation in Linux
- limit way
- different between segmentation and paging
- the reasons of choosing paging
- __USER/KERNEL_CS/DS

*** 2.3.1. The Linux GDT
- cpu_gdt_table, cpu_gdt_desc
- 18 and 14
- 4, 1, 1, 3, 3, 5

** 2.4. Paging in Hardware
- what is page
- contiguous linear addresses within a page are mapped into contiguous physical addresses
- page frame

*** 2.4.1. Regular Paging
- three parts: directory, table, offset
- two steps
- reduce the memory
- alloc directory
- cr3
- the fields of Page Directory and Page Table

*** 2.4.2. Extended Paging
-
