* 1.1  The Elements of Programming
- 语言的三个机制
  - primitive expressions, means of combination, means of abstraction
- In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and
  data.
- procedures are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data.
- any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and
  primitive procedures and should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and
  data.
- In this chapter we will deal only with simple numerical data so that
  we can focus on the rules for building procedures.
** 1.1.1 Expressions
- 介绍几个lisp表达示的优点
  - (+ 137 349)
  - (+ 21 35 12 7)
  - (+ (* 3 5) (- 10 6))
  - (+ (* 3
           (+ (* 2 4)
              (+ 3 5)))
        (+ (- 10 7)
           6))
** 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment
- In the Scheme dialect of Lisp, we name things with `define'.
- (define size 2)
- (define circumference (* 2 pi radius))
- `Define' is our language's simplest means of abstraction, for it
allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound
operations, such as the `circumference' computed above.

** 1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations
- To evaluate a combination, do the following:
  - 1. Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
  - 2. Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost
          subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the
          values of the other subexpressions (the operands).
** 1.1.4 Compound Procedures
- elemets in lisp
  * Numbers and arithmetic operations are primitive data and
     procedures.
  * Nesting of combinations provides a means of combining operations.
  * Definitions that associate names with values provide a limited
     means of abstraction.
- Now we will learn about "procedure definitions", a much more powerful
abstraction technique by which a compound operation can be given a name
and then referred to as a unit.
- (define (square x) (* x x))
- (define (<NAME> <FORMAL PARAMETERS>) <BODY>)
- The <BODY> is an expression that will
yield the value of the procedure application when the formal parameters
are replaced by the actual arguments to which the procedure is
applied.
     (define (f a)
       (sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2)))
 
** 1.1.5 The Substitution Model for Procedure Application
- applicative order versus normal order
- applicative order
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     (sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2))
     (sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))
     (+ (square 6) (square 10))
     (+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))
     (+ 36 100)
     136
#+END_EXAMPLE
- normal order
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     (sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))

     (+    (square (+ 5 1))      (square (* 5 2))  )

     (+    (* (+ 5 1) (+ 5 1))   (* (* 5 2) (* 5 2)))

     (+         (* 6 6)             (* 10 10))

     (+           36                   100)

                         136

** 1.1.6 Conditional Expressions and Predicates
-  
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   (cond (<P1> <E1>)
           (<P2> <E2>)
           ...
           (<PN> <EN>))

     (define (abs x)
       (cond ((< x 0) (- x))
             (else x)))

     (define (abs x)
       (if (< x 0)
           (- x)
           x))

     (if <PREDICATE> <CONSEQUENT> <ALTERNATIVE>)

   (and <E1> ... <EN>)

   (or <E1> ... <EN>)

   (not <E>)
   #+END_EXAMPLE
- Notice that `and' and `or' are special forms, not procedures, because
the subexpressions are not necessarily all evaluated.  `Not' is an
ordinary procedure.
- 
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     (define (>= x y)
       (or (> x y) (= x y)))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

- Observe that our model of evaluation allows for
     combinations whose operators are compound expressions.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** 1.1.7 Example: Square Roots by Newton's Method
- In mathematics we are usually concerned with declarative (what is)
descriptions, whereas in computer science we are usually concerned with
imperative (how to) descriptions.

** 1.1.8 Procedures as Black-Box Abstractions
- when we define the
`good-enough?' procedure in terms of `square', we are able to regard
the `square' procedure as a "black box.
- Indeed, as far as the `good-enough?' procedure is concerned, `square' is not
quite a procedure but rather an abstraction of a procedure, a so-called "procedural
abstraction".
- local names
  - One detail of a procedure's implementation that should not matter to
the user of the procedure is the implementer's choice of names for the
procedure's formal parameters.
  - bound variable and bind
    - A formal parameter of a procedure has a very special role in the
procedure definition, in that it doesn't matter what name the formal
parameter has.  Such a name is called a "bound variable", and we say
that the procedure definition "binds" its formal parameters.
  - scope
    - The set of expressions for which
a binding defines a name is called the "scope" of that name.

- Internal definitions and block structure
  - To make this possible, we allow a procedure to have internal definitions that are local to that procedure.Such nesting of definitions, called "block structure", is basically
the right solution to the simplest name-packaging problem.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     (define (sqrt x)
       (define (good-enough? guess x)
         (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
       (define (improve guess x)
         (average guess (/ x guess)))
       (define (sqrt-iter guess x)
         (if (good-enough? guess x)
             guess
             (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
       (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
#+END_EXAMPLE
  - This discipline is called "lexical scoping".
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     (define (sqrt x)
       (define (good-enough? guess)
         (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

         (average guess (/ x guess)))
       (define (sqrt-iter guess)
         (if (good-enough? guess)
             guess
             (sqrt-iter (improve guess))))

** 1.2.1 Linear Recursion and Iteration

#+END_EXAMPLE
- recursive process
  - This type
of process, characterized by a chain of deferred operations, is called
a "recursive process".
- deferred operations
  - The expansion occurs as the process builds up a chain of operations
"deferred operations" (in this case, a chain of multiplications).
- linear recursive process
  - hence the amount of information needed to keep
track of it, grows linearly with n (is proportional to n), just like
the number of steps.  Such a process is called a "linear recursive
process".
- iterative process
  - We call this an "iterative process".
- linear iterative process
  - In computing n!, the number of steps required grows linearly with n.  Such
a process is called a "linear iterative process".
- In the iterative case, the program variables provide a complete
description of the state of the process at any point.
- a recursive "process" and a a recursive "procedure"
  - When we describe a procedure as recursive, we
are referring to the syntactic fact that the procedure definition
refers (either directly or indirectly) to the procedure itself.  But
when we describe a process as following a pattern that is, say,
linearly recursive, we are speaking about how the process evolves, not
about the syntax of how a procedure is written.

** 1.2.2 Tree Recursion
- Fibonacci numbers
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 13, 21, ...


     (define (fib n)
       (cond ((= n 0) 0)
             ((= n 1) 1)
             (else (+ (fib (- n 1))
                      (fib (- n 2))))))

                         ..<............ fib5   <..........
                      ...     ___________/  \___________   .

#+END_EXAMPLE
  - In general,
the number of steps required by a tree-recursive process will be
proportional to the number of nodes in the tree, while the space
required will be proportional to the maximum depth of the tree.

** 1.2.3 Orders of Growth
- Let n be a parameter that measures the size of the problem, and let
R(n) be the amount of resources the process requires for a problem of
size n.
- We say that R(n) has order of growth [theta](f(n)), written R(n) =
[theta](f(n)) (pronounced "theta of f(n)"), if there are positive
constants k_1 and k_2 independent of n such that

     k_1 f(n) <= R(n) <= k_2 f(n)
- For instance, with the linear recursive process for computing
factorial described in section *Note 1-2-1:: the number of steps grows
proportionally to the input n.
- Orders of growth provide only a crude description of the behavior of
a process.
** 1.2.4 Exponentiation
- 
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     b^n = b * b^(n - 1)
     b^0 = 1
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- This is a linear recursive process, which requires [theta](n) steps
and [theta](n) space.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
     (define (expt b n)
       (if (= n 0)
           1
           (* b (expt b (- n 1)))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- This version requires [theta](n) steps and [theta](1) space.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
     (define (expt b n)
       (expt-iter b n 1))

     (define (expt-iter b counter product)
       (if (= counter 0)
           product
           (expt-iter b
                     (- counter 1)
                     (* b product))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- We can
also take advantage of successive squaring in computing exponentials in
general if we use the rule
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     b^n = (b^(b/2))^2    if n is even
     b^n = b * b^(n - 1)  if n is odd

     (define (fast-expt b n)
       (cond ((= n 0) 1)
             ((even? n) (square (fast-expt b (/ n 2))))
             (else (* b (fast-expt b (- n 1))))))

  #+END_EXAMPLE
  - The process evolved by `fast-expt' grows logarithmically with n in
both space and number of steps.

** 1.2.5 Greatest Common Divisors
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b is defined to
be the largest integer that divides both a and b with no remainder.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
     GCD(206,40) = GCD(40,6)
                 = GCD(6,4)
                 = GCD(4,2)
                 = GCD(2,0)
                 = 2

     (define (gcd a b)
       (if (= b 0)
           a
           (gcd b (remainder a b))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- The fact that the number of steps required by Euclid's Algorithm has
logarithmic growth bears an interesting relation to the Fibonacci
numbers

** 1.3 Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures
- To express such patterns
as concepts, we will need to construct procedures that can accept
procedures as arguments or return procedures as values.  Procedures
that manipulate procedures are called "higher-order procedures".

** 1.3.1 Procedures as Arguments
-
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
     (define (sum-integers a b)
       (if (> a b)
           0
           (+ a (sum-integers (+ a 1) b))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     (define (sum-cubes a b)
       (if (> a b)
           0
           (+ (cube a) (sum-cubes (+ a 1) b))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
       1       1       1
     ----- + ----- + ------ + ...
     1 * 3   5 * 7   9 * 11

     (define (pi-sum a b)
       (if (> a b)
           0
           (+ (/ 1.0 (* a (+ a 2))) (pi-sum (+ a 4) b))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     (define (<NAME> a b)
       (if (> a b)
           0
           (+ (<TERM> a)
              (<NAME> (<NEXT> a) b))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     (define (sum term a next b)
       (if (> a b)
           0
           (+ (term a)
              (sum term (next a) next b))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     (define (inc n) (+ n 1))

     (define (sum-cubes a b)
       (sum cube a inc b))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     (define (pi-sum a b)
       (define (pi-term x)
         (/ 1.0 (* x (+ x 2))))
       (define (pi-next x)
         (+ x 4))
       (sum pi-term a pi-next b))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

** 1.3.2 Constructing Procedures Using `Lambda'

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     (define (pi-sum a b)
       (sum (lambda (x) (/ 1.0 (* x (+ x 2))))
            a
            (lambda (x) (+ x 4))
            b))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- In general, `lambda' is used to create procedures in the same way as
`define', except that no name is specified for the procedure:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
     (lambda (<FORMAL-PARAMETERS>) <BODY>)
  #+END_EXAMPLE
-  The resulting procedure is just as much a procedure as one that is
created using `define'.  The only difference is that it has not been
associated with any name in the environment.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
     (define (plus4 x) (+ x 4))
     is equivalent to
     (define plus4 (lambda (x) (+ x 4)))

  #+END_EXAMPLE
- Like any expression that has a procedure as its value, a `lambda'
expression can be used as the operator in a combination such as
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
     ((lambda (x y z) (+ x y (square z))) 1 2 3)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- Using `let' to create local variables

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
     f(x,y) = x(1 + xy)^2 + y(1 - y) + (1 + xy)(1 - y)

     (define (f x y)
       (define (f-helper a b)
         (+ (* x (square a))
            (* y b)
            (* a b)))
       (f-helper (+ 1 (* x y))
                 (- 1 y)))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     (define (f x y)
       ((lambda (a b)
          (+ (* x (square a))
             (* y b)
             (* a b)))
        (+ 1 (* x y))
        (- 1 y)))
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- This construct is so useful that there is a special form called
`let' to make its use more convenient.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     (define (f x y)
       (let ((a (+ 1 (* x y)))
             (b (- 1 y)))
         (+ (* x (square a))
            (* y b)
            (* a b))))

     (let ((<VAR1> <EXP1>)
           (<VAR2> <EXP2>)
           ...
           (<VARN> <VARN>))
        <BODY>)
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- `Let' allows one to bind variables as locally as possible to where
     they are to be used.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

          (+ (let ((x 3))
               (+ x (* x 10)))
             x)
  #+END_EXAMPLE
-   This
     matters when the expressions that provide the values for the local
     variables depend upon variables having the same names as the local
     variables themselves.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
          (let ((x 3)
                (y (+ x 2)))
            (* x y))
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- Sometimes we can use internal definitions to get the same effect as
with `let'.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     (define (f x y)
       (define a (+ 1 (* x y)))
       (define b (- 1 y))
       (+ (* x (square a))
          (* y b)
          (* a b)))
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- We prefer, however, to use `let' in situations like this and to use
internal `define' only for internal procedures.

** 1.3.3 Procedures as General Methods
- can define lambda as a parameter.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     (half-interval-method (lambda (x) (- (* x x x) (* 2 x) 3))
                           1.0
                           2.0)
     1.89306640625
  #+END_EXAMPLE

** 1.3.4 Procedures as Returned Values

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
     (define (average-damp f)
       (lambda (x) (average x (f x))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- `Average-damp' is a procedure that takes as its argument a procedure
`f' and returns as its value a procedure (produced by the `lambda')
that, when applied to a number `x', produces the average of `x' and `(f
x)'.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  

     ((average-damp square) 10)
     55
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- Elements with the fewest restrictions are said to have "first-class" status.
